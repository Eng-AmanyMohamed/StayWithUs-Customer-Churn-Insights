# 📊 StayWithUs-Customer-Churn-Insights
**This is the graduation project for the Data Engineer Track at DEPI (Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative)**

### 🎯 Project Overview

Customer churn—when customers stop using a company’s product or service—is a major challenge impacting revenue and growth. 
StayWithUs is an end-to-end data engineering and machine learning project that leverages historical customer data to predict churn risk and empower businesses with actionable retention strategies.
By combining exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic insights, this project transforms raw customer data into a powerful tool for reducing attrition and enhancing customer lifetime value.

---
### 🧩 Key Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover behavioral patterns linked to churn.
- Preprocess and clean customer data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to predict churn.
- Deploy the model via a user-friendly interface (Flask app).
- Recommend targeted retention strategies based on model insights.
